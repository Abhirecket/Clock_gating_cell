# Clock_gating_cell
 Clock gating is a technique used in synchronous circuits to reduce dynamic power dissipation and power wasted by digital circuits. It involves turning off the clock to certain parts of the digital design when not needed.
### RTL Description: Clock Gating Cell (CGC)

- **Module Name**: cgc
- **Company**: College of VLSI

#### Overview:
The `cgc` module implements a Clock Gating Cell (CGC) that allows for gating the clock signal based on an enable signal. It ensures that the clock signal is only propagated when the enable signal is active, thereby reducing power consumption in the design.

#### Functional Description:
- **Inputs**: The module has three inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `enable` (enable signal), and `rst` (reset signal).
- **Outputs**: The output `gated_clk` is the gated clock signal.
- **Logic**:
  - The `enable` signal is sampled at the negative edge of the clock (`clk`) to avoid glitches.
  - The `enable` signal is synchronized to avoid metastability issues.
  - When the `enable` signal is asserted (`enable = 1`), the `gated_clk` output follows the `clk` input. Otherwise, it is held low (`0`).
- **Reset Handling**: The module resets the `enable_q` and `enable_sync` registers to ensure proper initialization on reset (`rst`).
- **Clock Gating**: The gated clock signal is generated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the clock signal (`clk`) and the synchronized enable signal (`enable_q`).
- **Dependencies**: This module has no external dependencies.

#### Target Devices and Tool Versions:
This RTL design does not specify target devices or tool versions. It is generic and can be synthesized using various Verilog synthesis tools.

#### Additional Comments:
- Clock Gating Cells (CGCs) are commonly used in digital designs to reduce power consumption by gating the clock signal when it is not needed.
- Proper synchronization of the enable signal is essential to avoid metastability issues.
- The module ensures that the gated clock signal is synchronized with the clock signal to maintain proper timing characteristics.
